## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate( 
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)
```

Create month name

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble( 
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month and trash collected. Some specific trash
types that are reported on include `cigarette_butts`, `chip_bags` and
`plastic_bottles`, among others. There are also some metrics regarding
the trash including `weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards`. There are a
total of 344 rows in the final dataset and a total of 14 columns. The
median number of sportsballs in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

Additional data sheets include precipitation data by month. Here, we
looked specifically at the years 2017 and 2018. There are a total of 24
rows in the data for these two years. The columns in the datset include
year, month, total, month\_name. The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33.
