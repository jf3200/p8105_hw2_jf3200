## Problem 1

Read the Mr. Trashwheel dataset.

``` r
trashwheel_df = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
    range = cell_cols("A:N")) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(dumpster) %>% 
  mutate( 
    sports_balls = round(sports_balls),
    sports_balls = as.integer(sports_balls)
  )
```

Read in precipitation data for 2018 and 2017

``` r
precip_2018 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2018 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2018) %>% 
  relocate(year)

precip_2017 = 
  read_excel(
    "./data/Trash-Wheel-Collection-Totals-8-6-19.xlsx",
    sheet = "2017 Precipitation", 
    skip = 1
  ) %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  drop_na(month) %>% 
  mutate(year = 2017) %>% 
  relocate(year)
```

Combine annual precipitation

``` r
precip_df = 
  bind_rows(precip_2017, precip_2018)
```

Create month name

``` r
month_df = 
  tibble( 
    month = 1:12, 
    month_name = month.name
  )

precip_df = 
  left_join(precip_df, month_df, by = "month")
```

This dataset contains information from the Mr. Trashwheel trash
collector in Baltimore, MD. As trash enters the harbor, the trashwheel
collects that trash and stores it in a dumpster. The dataset contains
information on year, month and trash collected. Some specific trash
types that are reported on include `cigarette_butts`, `chip_bags` and
`plastic_bottles`, among others. There are also some metrics regarding
the trash including `weight_tons` and `volume_cubic_yards`. There are a
total of 344 rows in the final dataset and a total of 14 columns. The
median number of sportsballs in a dumpster in 2017 was 8.

Additional data sheets include precipitation data by month. Here, we
looked specifically at the years 2017 and 2018. There are a total of 24
rows in the data for these two years. The columns in the datset include
year, month, total, month\_name. The total precipitation in 2018 was
70.33and the total in 2017 was 32.93.

## Problem 2

Read in NYC Transit Data

``` r
transit_df = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude,    starts_with("route"),entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>% 
  mutate_at(vars(route8:route11), as.character) %>% 
  pivot_longer(route1:route11, 
               names_to = "route_number", 
               values_to = "route_name") %>% 
  drop_na(route_name)
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   .default = col_character(),
    ##   `Station Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Station Longitude` = col_double(),
    ##   Route8 = col_double(),
    ##   Route9 = col_double(),
    ##   Route10 = col_double(),
    ##   Route11 = col_double(),
    ##   ADA = col_logical(),
    ##   `Free Crossover` = col_logical(),
    ##   `Entrance Latitude` = col_double(),
    ##   `Entrance Longitude` = col_double()
    ## )

    ## See spec(...) for full column specifications.

This dataset contains data related to the entrances and exits for each
subway station in NYC.

The cleaning steps thus far have included renaming the columns to be all
snake-case and lowercase using `janitor::clean_names`. Next, I used
`select()`to retain the columns of interest and converted `entry`from a
character to a logical variable. These data were not in a tidy format.
Having route1- route11 each as columns indicates to us that this may not
be the tidiest way to present the data. In order to tidy these data, I
first converted all of the route variables to be of the same class using
`as.character()`, and then I used `pivot_longer` to create the variables
`route_name` (A/B/C/1/2/3, etc) and `route_number`(route1, route2, etc).
There were many `NA` values in the route name after the data tidying
step, so these were omitted using `drop_na()`

Following the data tidying, there are 4270 rows and 10 columns. The
variables in this dataset include `line`, station-level variables such
as name, latitude and longitude, `route_name` and `route_number`,
`entry`, `vending`, `entrance_type` and `ada`, which indicates ADA
compliance.

Find distinct stations and answer questions

``` r
#Make this a dataframe to call since we will use it to answer multiple questions

transit_df_distinct =  
  transit_df %>% 
    distinct(station_name,line, .keep_all = TRUE)
```

  - The number of distinct stations defined by name and line is 465.
  - The number of stations that are ADA compliant is 84.
  - The proportion of station entrances/ exits without vending that
    allow entrance is 0.31
  - The number of distinct stations that serve the A train is 60
  - Of the stations that serve the A train 17 are ADA compliant
